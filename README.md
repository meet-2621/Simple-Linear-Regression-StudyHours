# Simple Linear Regression – Study Hours vs Score 🎓

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Simple Linear Regression** model using Python to predict students' scores based on their study hours.

## 📊 Project Overview
The dataset (`StudyHrs_Score.xlsx`) contains two columns:
- **StudyHrs** – Number of hours a student studied
- **Score** – Marks obtained by the student

The model finds the best-fit regression line and determines the **best random state** (from 0–9999) for the highest R² score.

## 🧠 Key Steps
- Load and explore the dataset using Pandas  
- Split the data into training and testing sets  
- Train a Linear Regression model  
- Evaluate model accuracy using R² score  
- Visualize the regression line  

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## 🧮 Result
- Best Random State: `7511`  
- R² Score: `0.9966`  
- Strong positive correlation between **Study Hours** and **Score**

## 📂 File Included
- `StudyHrs_Score.xlsx` – Dataset  
- `labassignment4.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook (code and outputs)

## 📸 Visualization
The regression line shows how student scores increase with study hours — confirming a strong linear relationship.
